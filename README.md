# Friend-Finder-CLI

Friend Finder is a simple version of a dating app. Users are supposed to answer the quiz questions (choosing answers from 1 to 5). The app takes a user's survey results, compares the answers with those from other users and displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You can see the app in action on Heroku
